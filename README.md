# how i setup new macOS system

Just dipping my toes into this after looking over many others' dotfiles. Step-by-step:

### sign into icloud and authorize the device.

### install command-line tools. 

Expect a prompt, click install.

```sh
xcode-select --install
```

### Update all AppStore/macOS software updates

Opens context/mode window. Then install window does the installing.

```sh
softwareupdate --install --all
```

### Set up `git`:

```sh
git config --global user.name 'ggiaever'
git config --global user.email 'ggiaever@gmail.com'
git config --global --list
```
To authenticate yourself to github (when you work from a private repo) you set that up by cloning a private repo at the command line and when it prompts you for your username you provide it and then it prompts you for your password and you provide that. then: 

```sh
git config --global credential.helper osxkeychain
git config --global credential.helper 'cache --timeout=10000000'
```

### set defaults for macOS

```sh
./macos-set-defaults.sh
```

### install homebrew
interactive 'return',may also prompt for password.
```sh
/usr/bin/ruby -e "$(curl -fsSL https://raw.githubusercontent.com/Homebrew/install/master/install)"
brew update
brew analytics off
```

Now make sure Brewfie is in home (e.g.`~/Brewfile`): `cp Brewfile ~/Brewfile`.

Note symlinking doesn't work.
```sh
brew bundle --verbose
brew cleanup
```

### SYSTEM MANUAL STUFF

Append what is in this folder's `.bash_profile` to `~/.bash_profile`

There is also something else i need to paste for brew bash completion

Can achieve with:
```sh
nano .bash_profile
```
